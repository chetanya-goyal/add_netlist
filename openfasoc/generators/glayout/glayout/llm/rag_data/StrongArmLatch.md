# Strong Arm Latch
A strong arm latch consists of an nmos differential pair called diffp, a cross coupled inverter component (CrossCoupledInverters), a bridge nfet called bridge, a clkgnd nfet, a tail nfet called tail, and two pfets clkpwrL1 and clkpwrL2 (west) and clkpwrR1 and clkpwrR2 (east). The tail nfet should be at the bottom. Diffp should be above tail and bridge should be above diffp. The cross couple inverters should be above bridge. clkpwrL1 and clkpwrL2 should be to the left of the cross coupled inverter and clkpwrR1 and clkpwrR2 should be the right of the cross coupled inverters. 
## Routing 
Only route together these ports, nothing else
1. Connect the source of diffp to the drain of tail. 
2. Connect the drain of bridge to the drain of the one of the nmos of diffp. 
3. Connect the source of bridge to the drain of the other nmos of diffp.
4. Connect the source of the left nmos of the cross coupled inverters to the drain of the left nmos. 
5. Connect the source of the right nmos of the cross coupled inverters to the drain of the right nmos. 
6. Connect the drain of clkpwrR2 (the rightmost pmos) to the drain of the right nmos of diffp
7. Connect the drain of clkpwrR1 to the drain the right nmos of the cross coupled inverters.
8. Connect the drain of clkpwrL2 (the leftmost pmos) to the drain of the left nmos of diffp
9. Connect the drain of clkpwrL1 to the drain the left nmos of the cross coupled inverters.
10. Connect the gates of clkpwrL1 and clkpwrL2 together.
11. Connect the gates of clkpwrR1 and clkpwrR2 together.
