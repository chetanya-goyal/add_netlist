# Differential Pair
A differential pair is an amplifier used to amplify the difference between two voltage input signals. It uses two nmos or pmos transistors, called left_mos and right_mos, with their sources shorted together. This kind of amplifier is able to achieve high gain and high input impedance. The single-ended output is taken from one end of the pair.
## Routing 
Only route together these ports, nothing else
1. Route together the source of left_mos and the source of right_mos.
