# Inverter or CMOS inverter
An inverter is a two transistor circuit that is able to invert the input signal. In simpler terms, an input signal that is classified as input high, creates an output low signal and vice versa. It uses a PMOS, called pullup, and NMOS, called pulldown. 
## Routing 
Only route together these ports, nothing else
1. Route the drain of pullup to the drain of pulldown.
2. Route the gate of pullup to the gate of pulldown.
