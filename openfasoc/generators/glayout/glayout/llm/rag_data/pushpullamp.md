# Push Pull or Class B Amplifier
A push-pull amplifier typically consists of two transistors, a nmos and pmos called sink and src respectively. This topology is useful as it unifies sourcing and sinking to achieve better power efficiency and cancellation of even harmonics in the spectral output. 
## Routing 
Only route together these ports, nothing else
1. Connect the gates of src and sink 
2. Connect the source of src to the source of sink
