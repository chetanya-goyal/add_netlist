place a pmos called p1 with width=p1_width, length=p1_length, fingers=p1_fingers, rmult=1, multipliers=1, with_substrate_tap=False, with_tie=True, with_dummy=True,

place a mimcap called c3

// more than one component has been placed, so move
move p1 right next to c3
move c5 below c3
move n1 below p1
move n1 right next to c5
