MimCapArray
create a float parameter called size
place a mimcap called m1 with size=size
place a mimcap called m2 with size=size
place a mimcap called m3 with size=size
place a mimcap called m4 with size=size
place a mimcap called m5 with size=size
place a mimcap called m6 with size=size
move m2 right of m1
move m3 right of m2
move m4 below m1
move m5 right of m4
move m6 right of m5
move m5 below m1
move m6 below m2
